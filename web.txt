<h3>How does the internet work?</h3>

<p>The internet is stuctured on a network or a frame work composing 
of computers/devices, routers, servers, network service providers. The 
network is how computers communicate with each other and is also how 
the Web works. The web is a service built on top of the internet network 
structure</p>


<h3>What happens when you click a link</h3>

<p>When a link is clicked the https protocal runs. This then goes through 
your local Domain Name Service cache to find the IP address. If the IP is 
not found it goes to your router to find the IP address. If not found it 
goes through your Internet Service Provider(ISP). If not found it communicates
with other ISP on the web. If not found there it goes to the Root DNS server
for .com .net .biz etc. to pull the IP address. Once found the IP address is 
returned to your computer, which then sends a request to the specified IP address
to access the server to display the page requested. </p>
